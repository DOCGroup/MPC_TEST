Running the tests
-----------------

Before running the tests you should have the $MPC_ROOT environment variable
set or have the $ACE_ROOT environment variable set with MPC checked out into
$ACE_ROOT.  Run run_tests.pl to run all of the MPC tests.  The run_tests.pl
script will generate all of the supported MPC project types and attempt to
build at least one of the project types in order to ensure that things get
generated correctly after the project has been built.  A warning will be
printed if it is unable to build for at least one project type.

Adding a new test
-----------------

1) Create a directory under the 'tests' directory containing the test.
   a) A 'config' directory is automatically added via the -include option when
      MPC is run.
   b) The library path (for whatever platform you are testing on) is set to
      contain the full path up to the name of your test with a /lib
      appended if it is necessary for the particular project type.
   c) If a workspace (.mwc file) of the same name as your test directory
      exists in the test directory, it will be passed to MPC.
   d) If the test needs to run anything, a run_test.pl should be
      placed in the root of the test directory.  This perl script should
      return zero when successful and non-zero when not.  A run_test.pl
      script is optional.

2) With the $ACE_ROOT environment set, run run_tests.pl with the --expected
   option to create the expected results for all tests.

3) Add the test and expected results to CVS.
   NOTE: Anything added to the expected directory needs the -kb option to
   cvs to ensure that carriage return/line feeds are preserved.
