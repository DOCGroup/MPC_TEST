          Updated the expected results for nmake.

        * run_tests.pl:

          Added ./ to run configure.  Dot isn't always in the path of the
          tester.

        * tests/conditional_specific_verbatim_wildcards/source/csvw.mpc:

          Modified this test to exercise whitespace insensitivity for file
          exclusions.

          Added a new test for implicit projects with a base project
          provided in the workspace.

        * expected/*/nmake/*:
        * expected/*/vc8/*:

          Created new expected results for the nmake and vc8 project types.

        * run_tests.pl:

          Modified the script to only move expected results that are truly
          different.

        * tests/conditional_specific_verbatim_wildcards/source/conditional/windows.cpp:
        * tests/wide_coverage/generator/generator.cpp:

          Changed from mkdir to CreateDirectory to avoid build warnings with
          vc8.

        * expected/*/gnuace/*:

          Added new expected results for the gnuace project type.

        * run_tests.pl:

          Added a --output option to specify an output file.  Also, don't
          compare gnuace workspaces.

        * README:

          Added a note about GNUmakefiles.

          Take CVS directories into account.

        * MPC test framework:

          This test framework can be used to ensure that functional changes
          to MPC will not break most use cases.  As more tests are added to
          cover functionality not already covered in the current tests, we
          can continue to keep MPC in a stable state.

          Please see the README for running and adding new tests.
