        * expected/*/vc8/*:

          Created new expected results for the nmake and vc8 project types.

          Modified the script to only move expected results that are truly
          different.

        * tests/wide_coverage/generator/generator.cpp:

        * MPC test framework:

          This test framework can be used to ensure that functional changes
          to MPC will not break most use cases.  As more tests are added to
          cover functionality not already covered in the current tests, we
          can continue to keep MPC in a stable state.

          Please see the README for running and adding new tests.
